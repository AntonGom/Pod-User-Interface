# Pod-User-Interface

Only compatible with PS4, download to a USB drive then plug it into your PS4 to be able to load the level. Enjoy the hundreds of hours I have dedicated to this project! Feel free to look at the logic and tweak it to your liking! For questions about logic placement feel free to send me a message and I can point you into the right direction when trying to dissect to logic. 

-User Interface logic is scattered throughout the level but for the animation logic it is placed inside the sackbot circuit board.

-Button mapping is placed inside the controlinator located in the upper right part of the map

-Level lighting is placed under the pod

-Pod user interface controls are placed next to the pod inside the yellow circuit board

-Remember that the wiring of the level can be disabled by turning off the level layers!
